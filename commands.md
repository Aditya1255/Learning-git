# Important git commands

## Beginner level commands

- `git init` -- it initializes a new git repository. What is a repository? -- It is a folder managed by git where we can track all
  the changes we are making in the project.

- `git add <filename>` -- it is used to track the changes in the files for the next commit.

- `git commit -m <message>` -- It is like a snapshot of the project at a specific point of time. when we do commit git saves the state of our project and when we commit we should always include a message. If we find any bug in future then we can always rollback to last save point and that is why git commit is very important.
